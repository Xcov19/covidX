    Maximum number of gunicorn workers to run.
    Gunicorn documents recommend no more than 4-12 workers for
    a system doing hundereds/thousands of requests per second.

    Container practices say it is a good idea to only run a single process within
    a container - for Gunicorn, we are better off running atleast 2 processes

    The number 12 comes from the following line:

    `DO NOT scale the number of workers to the number of clients you expect to have.
    Gunicorn should only need 4-12 worker processes to handle hundreds or thousands of requests
    per second.`
